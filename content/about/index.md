# Greetings! 
Hello, my name is Yusheng Zhao. I come from Shanghai, China.

# Research Interests
I am mainly interested in Quantum Computation. More concretely in the fields of 
+ Quantum Simulation 
+ Quantum Error Correction and Mitigation
+ Quantum Optimal Pulse Control
+ Quantum Software development

# Background

I received my Master's degree in Physics from [Stony Brook
University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php) under the
supervision of [ Prof. Tzu-chieh
Wei](http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~twei/index.html).

I received my B.A in Physics and Computer Science from [New York
University](https://www.nyu.edu)


# Hackathon Experiences

I enjoy attending Hackathons. I have competed in the following ones.

* iQuHACK 2021 [Hybrid-Division Winner](https://github.com/iQuHACK/2021_Hybrid-Daemons)
* IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2021 [Rank
  9](https://github.com/qiskit-community/ibm-quantum-challenge-fall-2021/blob/main/leaderboard.md)
* CCF "Compass Cup" [Third Prize Winner](https://www.163.com/dy/article/HDHUCRN905385VQN.html)
* [QHack 2021 QML Challenges](https://github.com/XanaduAI/QHack2021/tree/main/QML_Challenges)

# Peripherals

Confucious once said that "If a workman wishes to do a good job, he must first
sharpen his tools." I try to use the best ergonomic keyboards and mice.
Hopefully they will prolong my career as a programmer.

I am currently using an [Ergodox-EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) keyboard with
[Logitech MX
Ergo](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.910-005178.html).

I have used [HHKB](https://hhkeyboard.us/) previously until my wrist starts to
hurt due to the small size of that keyboard forcing me to an awkward poise.

# Misc 

I have a wide variety of interests. They include [Linux
ricing](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-of-Linux-ricing?share=1),
jogging (PR: 10k at 5:21), swimming, tennis, and Water Rowing.

I used to enjoy ricing my [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
configuration. Currently, I found [Doom
Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) satisfying all my needs.

I use [Xmonad](https://xmonad.org/) to manage my windows on my Linux
workstation.
