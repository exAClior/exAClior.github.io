# Complexity Bound of Quantum Algorithm

Your intuition says the complexity of arbitrary algorithm should be upper
bounded by exponential time.

Consider quantum algorithm as isomorphism. During each step, you still have such
isomorphism property. How much entropy is removed from one to next? Final answer
has no entropy when compared to that of the true answer.
