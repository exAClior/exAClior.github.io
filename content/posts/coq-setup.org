* Why
Proof assistants like Coq and Lean4 are becoming more and more popular. However,
there is a lack of tutorials on how to set up a Coq project. As useful a tool as
they are to mathematicians in the 21st century, they are almost useless if not
configured to include other's libraries. This tutorial aims to fill this gap.

* Installation Guide
The first step in setting up a Coq Project is to install Coq. For the users who
merely want to try out Coq, please refer to [[https://github.com/coq/platform/releases/tag/2023.03.0][this guide]] or simply use your
favourite package management system like [[https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/coq][homebrew]] or [[https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/coq/][paru]].

The more advanced users may need to use libraries that's not included in the
above mentioned distributions of Coq. The Coq [[https://coq.inria.fr/download][homepage]] mentioned multiple ways
to install Coq with extendability. I will follow the method using [[https://opam.ocaml.org/][opam]], the
package manager for ~OCaml~. ~OCaml~ is the language used to write ~Coq~,
therefore ~Coq~ related libraries should remain "native" to ~OCaml~. Using
~opam~ has the advantage of keeping the toolchain in the ecosystem of ~OCaml~.

** Opam Preparation
You could visit the [[https://opam.ocaml.org/][homepage]] of ~opam~ to install it. To verify ~opam~ is
correctly installed, run the following command.

#+begin_src shell :results raw
opam --version
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
2.1.5

By default, ~opam~ will install a global ~OCaml~ compiler. ~OCaml~ code and
packages will conform to that version by default. We will create an
"environment" with a version of ~OCaml~ specifically for ~Coq~. The
"environment" where our ~OCaml~ compiler lives is called a *switch* in ~OCaml~.
To create the switch run the following code.

#+begin_src shell :results raw
opam switch create my-coq 4.10.2
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

<><> Installing new switch packages <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>  üê´

‚àó installed ocaml-base-compiler.4.10.2
‚àó installed ocaml-config.1
‚àó installed ocaml.4.10.2
Done.
# Run eval $(opam env --switch=my-coq) to update the current shell environment

After the creation of the ~switch~, we could change to that ~switch~ via

#+begin_src shell :results raw
opam switch my-coq
eval $(opam env)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
# Run eval $(opam env) to update the current shell environment

*** Roots
As a side note, you could also create a new ~root~ in ~OCaml~. A ~root~ is a
higher level of "environment" than ~switch~. It contains several ~switches~.
Packages installed in a ~root~ is sharable amongst ~switches~ under that same
root. We will not use them here.

** Install Coq
Now that ~opam~ is all installed and configured, we could go ahead and install
~Coq~. If you just want to install ~Coq~ you could run the following code

#+begin_src shell :results raw
# don't run this just yet
opam add coq $VERSION_NUMBER
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

However, as [[https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4160/2020sp/install_coq.html][this guide]] points out, ~Coq~ is highly sensitive to version number,
we would also like to fix the ~Coq~ version. We could achieve this using ~pin~
keyword like this

#+begin_src shell :results raw
# version 8.18.0 is most upto date version as of 2024/01/01
opam pin add coq 8.18.0
#+end_src

** Verification
Assuming you have following the guide til now, we could verify that you have
installed ~Coq~ correctly, run the following command.

#+begin_src shell :results raw
coqc -v
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
The Coq Proof Assistant, version 8.18.0
compiled with OCaml 4.10.2

** Packages
As alluded to before, ~Coq~ is not a standalone software. It is a proof
assistant. Therefore, it is highly likely that you will need to use some
libraries to help you with your proofs. The most common way to install packages
is to use ~opam~. To do so, you will first need to add the ~coq-released~ repo
to ~opam~.

#+begin_src shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
#+end_src

Now that you have added the repository, you could install packages from it.
Let's browse the repository first.

#+begin_src shell :results raw
opam search coq
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
# Packages matching: match(*coq*)
# Name                             # Installed # Synopsis

coq-algebra                        --          Basics notions of algebra

We could see that there are a lot of packages available. Let's take a closer
look at one of them

#+begin_src shell :results raw

The package looks like being under active development. Let's install it.

#+begin_src shell
opam instal coq-graph-theory
#+end_src

To end things in this section, we will show you three ways to find *logical
name* that is needed to tell ~Coq~ how to load a package. A *[[https://coq.inria.fr/refman/language/core/modules.html#term-logical-name][Logical Name]]* is
essentially a *path* to the ~Coq~ file on your machine of which your current
program needs to load. To get the logical name, you could either

#+begin_src shell :results raw
opam show --list-files coq-graph-theory | head -n1
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
/Users/yushengzhao/.opam/my-coq/doc/coq-graph-theory

#+begin_src shell :results raw
opam switch my-coq
eval $(opam env)
ls $(coqtop -where)/user-contrib
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
# Run eval $(opam env) to update the current shell environment
GraphTheory (this is the one)

mathcomp


** Afterwards
After the installation, you will want to examine what packages are installed
relating to ~Coq~. This can be achieved with

#+begin_src shell
opam list "coq-*" --installed
#+end_src

You may also want to explore other repositories that contains user developed
~Coq~ libraries, you may find them [[https://coq.inria.fr/coq-package-index][here]]. For example, you could run

#+begin_src shell
opam repo add coq-extra-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/extra-dev
#+end_src

to install ~extra-dev~ packages. They include more topics than ~released~
packages ableit being less stable.

* Project Creation
Now that ~Coq~ has been installed, let's talk about how to initialize a ~Coq~
project. There are three ways to generate a project skeleton. Firstly, you could
use ~dune~, ~OCaml~'s build system, to generate the skeleton for a ~Coq~
project. However, as [[https://coq.inria.fr/refman/practical-tools/utilities.html#building-a-coq-project-with-dune][this guide]] points out, this is still experimental.
Furthermore, I have found the ~dune-project~ file a bit cryptic, we will not
cover it here. But interested reader should read the [[https://coq.inria.fr/refman/practical-tools/utilities.html#building-a-coq-project-with-dune][previous]] referred guide and
[[https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/coq.html][dune's documentation]]. The second method is to use ~coq_makefile~. It's a tool
included with Coq which relies on ~makefile~ to generate a project skeleton.
Although it's widely used within the community, I have found it to be
restrictive in the templates it supports and others found the dependency on
~makefile~ system too [[https://coq.discourse.group/t/proposal-a-custom-build-tool-for-coq-projects/239][complicated]]. Interested reader should find [[https://coq.inria.fr/refman/practical-tools/utilities.html#coq-makefile][this guide]]
helpful.

We will focus on the third method, the use of [[https://github.com/coq-community/templates][template]] created by the
~coq-community~.

** Install Mustache
[[https://mustache.github.io/][Mustache]] is a tool that allows you to generate text from a template. It is
used by the ~coq-community~ to generate the project skeleton. To install it, run

#+begin_src shell
sudo gem install mustache
#+end_src

** Write meta.yml file
The ~coq-community~ template uses a ~meta.yml~ file to generate the project
skeleton. The file is written in [[https://yaml.org/][YAML]] format. The following is an example of
~meta.yml~ file.

#+begin_src yaml

  ## Documentation

  For more information about the project, see the [technical report][techreport]
  describing the formalization. See also the [coqdoc presentation][coqdoc] of the
  Coq source files from the latest release.

  ### Running extracted code

  To extract code and obtain the program, run
  ```shell
  make run_huffman.ml
  ```

  Next, open an OCaml toplevel (e.g., `ocaml`) and do
  ```ocaml
  #use "run_huffman.ml";;
  ```

  To get the code that gives the frequency string:
  ```ocaml
  let code = huffman "abbcccddddeeeee";;
  ```

  To code a string:
  ```ocaml
  let c = encode code "abcde";;
  ```

  To decode a string:
  ```ocaml
  decode code c;;
  ```

To see more examples, please refer to [[https://github.com/coq-community/templates][The meta.yml file]] section of the
~coq-community~ template's README.

** Generate Project
Now that we have the ~meta.yml~ file, we could generate the project skeleton
using the following command.

#+begin_src shell
cd <your-project>
TMP=$(mktemp -d); git clone https://github.com/coq-community/templates.git $TMP
$TMP/generate.sh # nix users can do instead: nix-shell -p mustache-go --run $TMP/generate.sh
git add <the_generated_files>
