# Quantum Error Correction, Compressed Sensing and Quantum Shadow Tomography

Quantum error correction requires the need to remove entropy from physical
qubits. But in order to know what kind of information you want to remove, you
would first have to know those information. This requires measurement. As we
know, measurement is costly. On a superconducting platform, the measurment time
is typically 10 times longer than that of two qubit gates while the single qubit
gate is so short that we could ignore them.(?source)

This creates a problem obviously. To circumvent this, could we use compressed
sensing or quantum shadow tomography to obtain the error syndrome information
with considerable improvement?
