* Why do we need W state?
Since ZX Calculus is complete, any linear map can be expressed into them. But
the problem is how to express into it efficiently.

By efficiently, I mean using as little spider as possible. Because essentially,
we would like to contract it and convert everything to a single number.

Normally, you could add up the contraction result of different ? Is this saving
time? Yes, if you are adding up large number of ZX Diagrams.
