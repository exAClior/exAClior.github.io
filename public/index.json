Hello, my name is Yusheng Zhao. I come from Shanghai, China. Research Interests I am mainly interested in Quantum Computation. More concretely in the fields of Quantum Simulation Quantum Error Correction and Mitigation Quantum Optimal Pulse Control Quantum Software development Background I received my Master’s degree in Physics from Stony Brook University under the supervision of Prof. Tzu-chieh Wei. I received my B.A in Physics and Computer Science from New York University Hackathon Experiences I enjoy attending Hackathons. I have competed in the following ones. iQuHACK 2021 Hybrid-Division Winner IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2021 Rank 9 CCF “Compass Cup” Third Prize Winner Other Interests I enjoy Linux ricing and Water Rowing. I used to enjoy ricing my Emacs configuration. Currently, I found Doom Emacs satisfying all my needs. Peripherals Confucious once said that “If a workman wishes to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools.” I try to use the best ergonomic keyboards and mice. Hopefully they will prolong my career as a programmer. I am currently using an Ergodox-EZ keyboard with Logitech MX Ergo. I have used HHKB previously until my wrist starts to hurt due to the small size of that keyboard forcing me to an awkward poise.
